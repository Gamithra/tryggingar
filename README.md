# Rental deposit calculator

According to the Article 40 of Icelandic Rent Act No. 36/1994, landlords must keep rental deposits in the highest available interest savings account. However, many landlords fail to do this, resulting in tenants losing out on interest earnings; furthermore the law does not specify how to calculate the interest owed. This tool provides a simple way to calculate the approximate interest owed.
